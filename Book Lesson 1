		<h1>Welcome to my first web page!</h1>
		<p>This is an HTML page I created in Sublime.</p>
		<p>This is an an example of what another paragraph would look like in HTML. It is my 1<sup>st</sup> I want to see how multiple lines will look so I'm just going to ramble for a bit. Or better yet, why don't I just copy and paste some content here: 
		<hr/>
		<b>Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an element is the largest, and the contents of an element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS. CO<sub>2</sub></b></p>

<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
